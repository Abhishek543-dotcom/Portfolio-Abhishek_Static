# Portfolio - Abhishek

This project is a static website serving as a personal portfolio for Abhishek. It showcases his skills, experience, education, projects, and contact information. The website is built using HTML and CSS, and it is designed to be simple, informative, and visually appealing.

## Structure

The website is organized into several sections, each represented by a separate HTML file:

-   **index.html**: The main entry point of the website, likely serving as a landing page or an overview.
-   **home.html**: Contains information about Abhishek, such as a brief introduction, skills, and interests.
-   **contact.html**: Provides contact details and possibly a contact form for visitors to reach out to Abhishek.
-   **education.html**: Lists Abhishek's educational background, including degrees, institutions, and certifications.
-   **experience.html**: Details Abhishek's professional experience, including previous roles, responsibilities, and achievements.
-   **projects.html**: Showcases projects that Abhishek has worked on, with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
-   **services.html**: Describes the services that Abhishek offers, such as web development, data science, or consulting.
-   **github.html**: Likely contains links to Abhishek's GitHub profile and repositories.

Each HTML file has a corresponding CSS file (e.g., `styles-home.css` for `home.html`) that provides styling and layout for that specific page.

## Images

The `images` directory contains various image assets used throughout the website. These include logos of companies and technologies, icons, and potentially personal photos or project screenshots.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the website.
-   **CSS**: Used for styling and layout of the website.

## How to View

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Improvements

-   Potentially add JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content.
-   Implement a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices.
-   Add more detailed project descriptions and case studies.
